            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello and welcome to Laura‚Äôs Lounge, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Laura and I live on a remote Croatian island with my pet dog Valentino. I spend my time doing what many people in this situation would do - uni work, swimming and gaming. Otherwise, I like to learn new and fun skills. I am currently learning 2 programming languages (Java and Python), a third language (Italian) and how to play the piano, which are all challenging in their own sense. Feel free to have a look around my webpage.
            </p>

            <h2>My Dog</h2>
              <p> This is Valentino, my moral support agent and best friend. He likes to go for <em>loooong</em> walks on the beach, ending the day with a nap. His favourite words are "oƒçemo iƒá ≈°etat?", (want to go for a walk?), which results in lots of happy barks!

            <p> This is the island of ≈†olta that I live on. As you can see, it is absolutely beautiful. The nature here is truly mesmerising! I was also fortunate enough to spend my childhood on this mesmerising island with my family each year growing up.
